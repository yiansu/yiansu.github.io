Hi :wave: and welcome to my page!

# About Me

I'm a third-year Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science, advised by [Simone Campanoni](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~simonec/index.html) at [Northwestern ARCANA Lab](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~simonec/Team.html).
My primary research interest lies in advancing the field of parallelizing compilers and multi-threaded scheduling techniques.
The goal of my research is to enable programmers to write generic parallel programs while generating portable and performant binaries for various parallel and heterogeneous systems.
Beyond that, I also interested in program analysis and compiler optimizations.
