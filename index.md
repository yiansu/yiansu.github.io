# About

:wave: **Hello!** I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science, advised by [Simone Campanoni](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~simonec/index.html) at [Northwestern ARCANA Lab](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~simonec/Team.html).
My primary research interest lies in advancing the field of parallel processing via compiler support and multi-threaded scheduling techniques.
My research aims to enable programmers to write generic parallel programs while producing portable and performant binaries for various parallel architectures and heterogeneous systems.
I am also interested in parallelizing compilers, code analysis, and compiler optimizations.
